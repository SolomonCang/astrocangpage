Using radio observations of FAST, we detected a new millisecond-scale radio burst on the M-type star AD Leo! The signal originates from small-scale magnetic fields in the stellar spotted regions. The relevant work was recently published in <i><a href='https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.adw6116'>Science Advances</a></i>.
