Welcome to my site. I am an astronomer specializing in stellar astrophysics. My research focuses on stellar magnetic fields, magnetic activity, and exoplanets by using photometric and spectropolarimetric data. I am interested in how magnetism shapes stellar evolution, drives variability, and influences the environments and habitability of planetary systems.
